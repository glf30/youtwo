# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`. YouTwo is a video streaming Youtube clone application that hosts a selection of seeded video data that users can browse through.  The app allows users to upload their own content, like and save videos, and make comments on other videos.  Users can either view their own saved videos by going to their playlists or other users saved videos/uploads by viewing their profiles

Run this app locally using
```
npm run dev
```

This app was built using Next.js, Tailwind, tRPC, NextAuth, PosgreSQL (PlanetScale), and Cloudinary.
